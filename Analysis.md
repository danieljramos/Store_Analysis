# Clients Using discount

More than half of the items sold are without discount. This means that 57% of customers have a good feeling about the brand and will buy it at the normal price. The remaining 43% only buy the items when there is a discount.


# Payment Method

All payment methods are used more or less equally. However, Paypal is the most popular of all. This is because Paypal offers security. However, Paypal usually charges higher commissions. 


# Size by Gender

Size M is the most popular size between the 2 sexes.
This tells us that our customers might be more fit, as M is popular among people with healthy habits.


# Churn & Retention Rate

![alt text](https://github.com/danieljramos/Analysis_pics/blob/main/chart%20(39).png?raw=true)

Customers keep buying for 50 months on average, losing around 5% of customers each month.
In general, we lose fewer women than men each period.

# Conclusions

- There are more men than women and they tend to spend equally.
- Women tend to be more loyal
- Young women spend more although they are fewer customers.
- Brand can be identified as expensive making customers wait to receive a discount to buy.
- Our customers are generally healthy.
- Once this customer buys, they are loyal.

# Recommendations

- To increase revenue, it is important to focus primarily on young women, who on average spend more and are more loyal than any other group.
- Try to avoid people using PayPal will reduce the cost, as PayPal has higher commission rate.
- Reducing XL size could reduce storage costs.
- Campaign to change customer perception about the quality, once working, reduce the discounts.
